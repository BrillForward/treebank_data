Celano & Gregory Crane","body":"### A Dependency Treebank for Ancient Greek and Latin\r\n\r\nThe Ancient Greek and Latin Dependency Treebank (AGLDT) is the earliest treebank for Ancient Greek and Latin. The project started at Tufts University, and is currently under development and maintenance at Leipzig University-Tufts University. Data and full documentation are made freely available on Github under a [CC BY-SA 3.0 Licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/). The present webpage is for presentational purposes only. Full information about the creation of the data is contained in the subfolders of the repository.   \r\n  \r\n### The Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank 2.0\r\nThe AGDT 2 has been created as a refinement and extension of the <a href=\"http://nlp.perseus.tufts.edu/syntax/treebank/\" target=\"_blank\">AGDT 1</a>. It defines the morphological and syntactic annotations more stringently, and adds a semantic layer built on the categories identified in [H. W. Smyth's Grammar](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0007). Since most annotations have been performed singularly by different annotators, the texts have been normalized and harmonized. Details on that can be found in the documentation attached to the data in the GreekLastRelease folder. \r\n\r\nThe texts available in the current database are the following:\r\n\r\nAuthor | Text \r\n------------ | -------------\r\nAesop | Fables (1.1-1.50)\r\nAeschylus | Agamemnon\r\n | Eumenides\r\n | Libation Bearers\r\n | Persians\r\n | Prometheus Bound\r\n | Seven Against Thebes\r\n | Suppliants\r\nAthenaeus | The Deipnosophists (12-13)\r\nDiodorus Siculus | Library (11)\r\nHerodotus | Histories (1)\r\nHesiod | Shield of Heracles\r\n | Theogony \r\n | Works and Days\r\nHomer | Iliad\r\nHomer | Odyssey\r\nLysias | Oration 1\r\nLysias | Oration 14\r\nLysias | Oration 15\r\nLysias | Oration 23\r\nPlato | Euthyphro\r\nPlutarch | Alcibiades\r\nPlutarch | Lycurgus\r\nPolybius | Histories (1)\r\nPseudo Apollodorus | Library (1.1.1-1.4.1)\r\nSophocles | Ajax\r\n | Antigone\r\n | Electra\r\n | Oedipus Tyrannus\r\n | Trachinae \r\nThucydides | Histories (1)\r\n\r\n### Contacts\r\nSend questions to (surname of Giuseppe above) at informatik.uni-leipzig.de","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
