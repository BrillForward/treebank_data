{"name":"The Ancient Greek and Latin Dependency Treebank","tagline":"Giuseppe G. A. Celano & Gregory Crane","body":"### A Dependency Treebank for Ancient Greek and Latin\r\n\r\nThe Ancient Greek and Latin Dependency Treebank (AGLDT) is the earliest treebank for Ancient Greek and Latin. The project started at Tufts University, and is currently under development and maintenance at Leipzig University-Tufts University. We distinguish two different versions of the AGLDT on the basis of the specification and guidelines adopted to annotate. Data and full documentation are made freely available on github under a [CC BY-SA 3.0 Licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/). The present webpage is for presentational purposes only. Full information about the creation of the data is contained in the subfolders of the repository.   \r\n  \r\n### The Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank 2\r\nThe AGDT 2 has been created as a refinement and extension of the <a href=\"http://nlp.perseus.tufts.edu/syntax/treebank/\" target=\"_blank\">AGDT 1</a>. It defines the morphological and syntactic annotations more stringently, and adds a semantic layer built on the categories identified in [H. W. Smyth's Grammar](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0007). The annotation process is elaborate, always consisting in the adjudication of double annotation, which is fully documented: besides the adjudication file, we provide source annotations and a detailed inter-annotator agreement report showing all their differences. The treebank currently contains passages from Aesop and Apollodorus.\r\n\r\nThe texts available in the database are the following:\r\n\r\nAuthor | Text \r\n------------ | -------------\r\nAesop | Fabulae\r\nAeschylus | Agamemnon\r\n | Eumenides\r\n | Libation Bearers\r\n | Persians\r\n | Prometheus Bound\r\n | Seven Against Thebes\r\n | Suppliants\r\nAthenaeus | The Deipnosophists (Book 12 and 13)\r\nDiodorus Siculus (Book 11)\r\nHerodotus | Historiae (Book 1)\r\nHesiod | Shield of Heracles\r\n | Theogony \r\n | Works and Days\r\nHomer | Odyssey\r\nHomer | Iliad\r\nLysias | Oration 1\r\nLysias | Oration 14\r\nLysias | Oration 15\r\nLysias | Oration 23\r\n Plato | Euthyphro\r\nPlutarch | Alcibiades\r\nPlutarch | Lycurgus\r\nPolybius | Historiae (Book 1)\r\nPseudo Apollodorus | Biblioteca\r\nSophocles | Ajax\r\n | Antigone\r\n | Electra\r\n | Oedipus Tyrannus\r\n | Trachinae \r\nThucydides | Historiae (Book 1)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contacts\r\nSend questions to (surname of Giuseppe above) at informatik.uni-leipzig.de\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
