{"name":"The Ancient Greek and Latin Dependency Treebank","tagline":"Project Directors: Giuseppe G. A. Celano & Gregory Crane","body":"### A Dependency Treebank for Ancient Greek and Latin\r\n\r\nThe Ancient Greek and Latin Dependency Treebank (AGLDT) is the earliest treebank for Ancient Greek and Latin. The project started at Tufts University, and is currently under development and maintenance at Leipzig University-Tufts University. We distinguish two different versions of the AGLDT on the basis of the specification and guidelines adopted to annotate. Data and full documentation are made freely available on github under a [CC BY-SA 3.0 Licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/). The present webpage is for presentational purposes only. Full information about the creation of the data is contained in the subfolders of the repository.   \r\n\r\n### The Ancient Greek and Latin Dependency Treebank 1\r\nThe AGLDT 1 contains texts annotated morphologically and syntactically. It comprises texts that have been annotated by two annotators and then adjudicated or annotations by a single scholar. The most recent version of these data is 1.7.    \r\n\r\n### The Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank 2\r\nThe AGDT 2 has been created as a refinement and extension of the AGDT 1. It defines the morphological and syntactic annotations more stringently, and adds a semantic layer built on the categories identified in [H. W. Smyth's Grammar](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0007). The annotation process is elaborate, always consisting in the adjudication of double annotation, which is fully documented: besides the adjudication file, we provide source annotations and a detailed inter-annotator agreement report showing all their differences. The treebank currently contains passages from Aesop and Apollodorus.\r\n\r\nThe texts available in the database are the following:\r\n\r\nAuthor | Text\r\n------------ | -------------\r\nHomer | Odyssey\r\nHomer | Iliad\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contacts\r\nSend questions to (surname of the first project director) at informatik.uni-leipzig.de\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
