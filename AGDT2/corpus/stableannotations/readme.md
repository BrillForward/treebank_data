## README

This folder contains the corpus for the Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank 2.0, created under the supervision of Giuseppe G. A. Celano: here you can find the treebanked texts with full documentation conterning the annotation procedure (texts of two annotators, inter-coder agreement report, adjudication file). In the main directory, I also provide a zip file only containing the adjudication files. The guidelines are documented in the treebank_data/AGDT2/guidelines folder.
